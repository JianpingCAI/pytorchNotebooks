This is a project called pytorchNotebooks created by Clayton Blythe on 2017/08/30 

I aim to convert much of [this very useful repository](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) into Jupyter Python notebooks, and even add some of my own cookbooks as well. 

I think that sharing and reusing code as much as possible through github and other tools like Arxiv will allow for speeding up machine learning research, benefiting society as a whole. 

1. Basic
* [Baby Steps](https://github.com/claytonblythe/pytorchNotebooks/blob/master/baby_steps.ipynb)
* [Introduction](https://github.com/claytonblythe/pytorchNotebooks/blob/master/intro.ipynb)
* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/claytonblythe/pytorchNotebooks/blob/master/linear_regression.ipynb)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/claytonblythe/pytorchNotebooks/blob/master/logistic_regression.ipynb)
* [Basic Neural Network](https://github.com/claytonblythe/pytorchNotebooks/blob/master/basic_neural_network.ipynb)

2. Intermediate
