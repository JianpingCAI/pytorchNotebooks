This is a project called pytorchNotebooks created by Clayton Blythe on 2017/08/30 

I am to convert much of [this very useful repository](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) into Jupyter Python notebooks, and even add some of my own cookbooks as well. 

I think that sharing and reusing code as much as possible through github and other tools like Arxiv will allow for speeding up machine learning research, benefiting society as a whole.
